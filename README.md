- 👋 Hi, I’m @LubnaSAP AKA Lubna Abdul.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Cognitive Neurocience, parallely I also apply some Machine learning tools to Neuroscience in an attemtp to further invetsigate cognitve behaviours or neural patterns. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about:
    - 1) the computations behind Episodic Inference Memory model.
    - 2) Decision making models.
    - 3) Design of cognitive tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projected related to computational neuroscience and machine learning, whether it's on helthy subjects or any related clinical topics
- 📫 How to reach me: please conctact me in the following email: shaheelub16@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I was young I wanted to study physics or neuroscience, first I got a degree in physics and after exploring a bit I did a master in neuroscience. Currently I am working on computational neuroscience, so, happy to have achieved both of my goals.
